# 1 Introduction
Tomography is a technique where imaging is done by sectioning the object with some penetrating wave. The uses of this method are mostly used in archaeology, radiology, material science biology etc. Various types of tomography include Aerial tomography with Electromagnetic radiation, Electron tomography done by transmission electron microscopy, Functional magnetic resonance imaging and many more. In this part, we will focus on radio tomography where the radio waves will be used for reconstruction of the environment. The ultimate objective is to reconstruct a comprehensive and detailed map of the environment. Achieving this goal demands a nuanced approach to path planning, where linear bandits play a pivotal role in optimising the solution. The way it will be done is by sending radio waves from a particular point and receiving the radio waves at some other point noting the total attenuation and reconstruction of the whole surrounding through proper path planning by the use of linear bandits, by framing it to a bandit model to solve the linear inverse problem with minimal and efficient amount of actions and data needed for reconstructing the whole map. Linear bandits, a concept borrowed from the field of artificial intelligence, are instrumental in framing the radio tomography problem into a bandit model. This approach allows for the efficient resolution of the linear inverse problem, minimising the number of actions and data required to reconstruct the entire map.

# 2 Background and Literature Review
## 2.1 Background
The use case of this is quite dominant in the practical aspects of imaging systems. First, radar systems transmit RF probes and receive the signals caused by the objects in an environment. A time delay between the transmission and reception describes the distance to the sender. Second, The measurements along the paths are used to compute an estimate of the spatial field of the transmission parameters throughout the medium which is done in the cases of computed tomography (CT) methods in medical and geophysical imaging systems that use signal measurements along many different paths through a medium.

# 3 Program and Design of the Problem and the solution
As for the Problem Design mostly under current circumstances it is done under the simulation where an Environment is designed that will make a 2 Dimensional Map of a given size and a particular sparsity will be generated terming it the real map of the environment, from this, an action is passed this action value is described as the location of the sender and the receiver
